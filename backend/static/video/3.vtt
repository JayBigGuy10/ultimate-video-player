IP
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.440
This video has been dubbed and subtitled
into several languages.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.520
On most devices, you can
call up YouTube’s settings,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.360
and switch between them.
And if you do,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.280
you’ll find that outside the
original language, English,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.960
the words in the subtitles and
dubbing often don’t match.

IP
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.640
Which happens a lot,
mostly in professional TV shows,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.920
and it can be frustrating
for those of us

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.880
who like to listen
but also use subtitles.

IP
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.320
The short reason why is:

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.920
subtitles and dubbing are usually done
by different teams of people.

IP
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.600
But to answer why that happens,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.720
I need to take you on a journey
that’s going to involve

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.560
geese, a roller coaster,
and this advert.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.400
This video is sponsored by NordVPN.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.440
That’s not a joke, this video is
actually sponsored by NordVPN,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.720
who have been very useful as
I’ve been travelling around!

IP
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.280
Now, in most of the languages
that advert was translated into,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.400
the subtitles and dubbing
pretty much match.

IP
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.960
In French, Spanish and Portuguese,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.040
the word order is roughly
the same as in English,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.000
and it’s a simple translation.

IP
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.680
But in the most obvious
Hindi translation,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.320
the company name sits in the
middle of the sentence,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.920
and standard practice for
modern professional dubbing

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.840
is to match lip movements
as closely as possible.

IP
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.640
Now, there is a way to rephrase
the sentence in Hindi

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.240
so that the company name
sits at the end.

IP
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.000
The dubbing team chose that option,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.760
and the lip movements
pretty much match.

IP
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.360
But the subtitling team didn’t
see any reason to do that,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.040
and so the lines are different.

IP
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.800
In Japanese, which has
the same problem,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.320
the dubbing team instead
found a translation

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.240
where the lip movements
look close enough.

IP
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.560
But why don’t they just
take the dubbing script,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.240
and then turn it
into subtitles?

IP
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.520
Why translate everything twice?

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.240
Well, subtitles have their
own limitations.

IP
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.040
I gave the translation teams
for this video

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.400
some deliberately
difficult examples.

IP
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.600
A few years ago, I made a video
on YouTube’s copyright systems,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.360
and it included this sidebar
about a song that I don’t like:

IP
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.800
Maroon 5’s Memories is an
infuriating composition

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.280
that uses the start of the melody
of Canon in D but never resolves it,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.240
which means it has the same
stuck-in-your-head effect

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.440
as the jingle from Alfred Bester’s
The Demolished Man,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.720
and I hate it.

IP
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.400
The modern approach to subtitling
in most languages

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.760
is that reading is
faster than talking,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.520
and that even for
fast talking like that,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.560
you put every word on screen.
The viewer can always pause.

IP
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.240
But that wasn’t always the case.

IP
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.480
If you watch anything in English that was
subtitled more than 10 or 15 years ago,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.280
like reruns on television
or movies on DVD,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.360
you’ll find the subtitles
often summarise what’s said.

IP
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.000
Style guides used to emphasise the skill in
“careful and sensitive subtitle editing”,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.880
because they thought it was important
that everyone got the meaning,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.440
even if they were a slow reader,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.720
because you couldn’t easily
pause and go back.

IP
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.840
And besides, why would someone who can hear
watch video with subtitles?

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.920
It’s not like we’d all end up with
tiny televisions in our pocket,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.920
or sound mixing changes would mean

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.480
dialogue was going to be
suddenly difficult to hear.

IP
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.120
In the original English version of
that Maroon 5 rant that I just did,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.160
I made a reference to
The Demolished Man by Alfred Bester,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.440
which isn’t that well-known
even in English.

IP
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.120
So for Japanese viewers, who have
probably never heard of it,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.200
the local subtitle translator decided
to remove the reference entirely

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.600
and get the same meaning
across in fewer characters.

IP
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.880
Opinions can differ, but I think
that’s a pretty solid decision.

IP
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.160
If they’d just taken the breathless,
high speed performance

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.560
of the Japanese voice actor,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.600
then it would have been a
worse experience for subtitle readers.

IP
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.880
And well done to the voice actor,
by the way!

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.840
That cannot have been easy.

IP
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.680
And this is just to translate
one person performing a script!

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.080
Imagine if it was a reality show,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.080
with six people shouting and
talking quickly

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.160
and stumbling their words
and interrupting each other.

IP
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.960
The subtitles would
have to summarise,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.000
while the voice actors for the dub
can shout over each other.

IP
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But it does mean that in this case,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.360
for some Japanese viewers,
that reference is lost.

IP
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.200
That’s one of the other
big challenges with translation.

IP
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.440
How much do you translate the words
versus translating the meaning?

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.560
Here’s another really difficult example.

IP
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.040
“Anyone want to buy some goslings?”

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.400
“They’re going cheep.”

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.560
The English version of that joke
is pretty much impossible to translate!

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.720
It relies not just on a pun, but
on knowledge of colloquial English.

IP
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.520
You have to know that “going”
can mean “making a noise”.

IP
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.760
You have to know that “cheep”
is the English word

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.080
for the noise that baby birds make,
cheep-cheep-cheep,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.640
and you have to know that
“going cheap”, spelled differently,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.920
is slang for “on sale
at a good price”.

IP
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.520
I loved seeing the responses from
the translators on this example.

IP
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.320
A couple of folks translated it
word for word,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.920
and just gave up on the joke.
Fair enough.

IP
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.960
But I do want to highlight
a couple of them.

IP
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.040
The Portuguese subtitle and dubbing teams
came up with the same joke!

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.760
And so did the Spanish subtitler.

IP
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.800
‘Ganso’ in both languages means ‘goose’,
and ‘cansado’ means ‘tired’,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.280
so they combined them
into the word ‘gansado’,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.240
and now I’m asking if anyone
wants the goslings

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.640
because I’m goose-slash-tired of them?
Brilliant.

IP
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.920
And both the French and Spanish
dubbing teams came up with

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.840
their own puns based on their languages’
words for bird noises,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.640
because yes, the sounds that animals
are said to make differ in each language!

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.880
And I love this!

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.200
This is translating meaning and intent,
not just words.

IP
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.080
In case you’re wondering,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.920
I did try several AI translation tools,
as well as just asking

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.400
a large language model
to translate this stuff,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.720
and as of right now,
as of 2023,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.560
capturing that nuance,
that meaning, that performance,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.760
definitely still requires humans.

IP
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.800
At least for the goose clip,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.520
the translators didn’t have
to match my lips.

IP
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.080
But they did have to
match the goose’s honk!

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.640
Because I talked over it,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.360
so they had to go to another bit
of the video that you didn’t see,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.360
copy and paste the background noise
and a different goose honk from there,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.640
and synchronize them up.

IP
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.760
Someone had to lip-sync a goose.

IP
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.640
Beak-sync, actually. I— they—
they don’t have lips.

IP
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.760
…I don’t think they have lips.

IP
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.000
All of which comes together
for this example.

IP
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.960
Last year, I made a video

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.400
where I tried to get over my
phobia of roller coasters.

IP
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.920
And, spoiler, I did!

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.880
And just after my terror changed to joy,
on a ride called Nemesis,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.920
I shouted this:

IP
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.320
Yes! Have it!

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.440
The original English
is “have it”.

IP
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.000
How on earth do you
translate “have it”?

IP
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.320
It’s got no literal meaning.

IP
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.120
And more than that,
it’s kind of obscure slang?

IP
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.520
Different people in
different parts of Britain

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.720
might use it for different things,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.360
and it’s almost impossible
to Google.

IP
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.200
In my context, it’s a cry of

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.040
excitement, triumph, adrenaline,
encouragement, success.

IP
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.480
It’s the sort of thing that you might
yell after your team scores a goal,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.040
or to cheer on your friend
after they’ve successfully

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.320
downed two pints of
lager back-to-back.

IP
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.320
It feels very male?
Very “drunken lads’ night out’?

IP
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.640
I did pass a note with all that
context on to the translators,

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.960
but for many productions
they won’t be working with notes.

IP
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.080
They’ll only have the original show,
and maybe the script, if there is one.

IP
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.400
So, here is that cry in all
the video’s languages.

IP
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.720
Subtitling teams have their
choice of any word or phrase,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.840
but they have to fit
the words on the screen.

IP
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.680
Dubbing teams can get
their voice actors

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.560
to emote in the studio
as much as possible…

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.520
but the lip movements
have to match.

IP
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.040
That’s why subtitles
and dubbing differ.

IP
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.920
And if you want a perfect
example of that:

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.520
…this advert has also been
translated into five languages!

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.120
And no matter which
one you speak,

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.920
you can push NordVPN’s
magic Quick Connect button,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.640
and your phone and computer
can pretend

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.680
they’re in any one of
around 60 countries,

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.680
from Albania to Vietnam.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.360
So if you’re travelling and want websites
to stop automatically translating for you,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.000
it’s easy! Or if you want to
watch stuff from another country,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.520
but it’s blocked where you are,
you can.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.920
(Just check the streaming service’s
terms and conditions first.)

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.320
NordVPN works on Windows, Linux,
Mac, iOS and Android,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.080
up to six devices
at the same time,

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.600
and there’s a 30-day
money-back guarantee.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.880
So if you’re not sure:
try it anyway.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.840
When I first used it, I thought
I’d only use it occasionally,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.360
but over the last year…

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.880
it really has come in handy for me,
time after time after time.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.040
I keep endorsing NordVPN because
it keeps being a thing I actually use.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.160
You can go to nordvpn.com/tomscott,
or scan the QR code,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.040
for the best deal they’re
offering right now,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.000
even if you’re watching this
in the future.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.200
I think that worked.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.760
Lovely.
