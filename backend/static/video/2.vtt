00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
This video has been dubbed and subtitled into several languages.

00:03.440 --> 00:06.640
On most devices you can call up YouTube settings and switch between them.

00:06.640 --> 00:10.240
And if you do, you'll find that outside the original language, English,

00:10.240 --> 00:13.840
the words in the subtitles and dubbing often don't match,

00:13.840 --> 00:18.880
which happens a lot, mostly in professional TV shows, and it can be frustrating for those of us

00:18.880 --> 00:24.560
who like to listen, but also use subtitles. The short reason why is subtitles and dubbing are

00:24.560 --> 00:29.360
usually done by different teams of people. But to answer why that happens, I need to take you on a

00:29.360 --> 00:33.760
journey that's going to involve Geese, a rollercoaster, and this advert.

00:34.400 --> 00:40.400
This video is sponsored by NordVPN. That's not a joke. This video is actually sponsored by NordVPN,

00:40.400 --> 00:44.880
who have been very useful, as I've been travelling around. Visit nordvpn.com slash Tom Scots to find

00:44.880 --> 00:50.640
the best deal they're offering right now. Now in most of the languages that that advert was translated

00:50.640 --> 00:55.920
into, the subtitles and dubbing pretty much match. In French, Spanish and Portuguese,

00:55.920 --> 01:00.720
the word order is roughly the same as in English, and it's a simple translation. But in the most

01:00.720 --> 01:06.160
obvious Hindi translation, the company name sits in the middle of the sentence, and standard practice

01:06.160 --> 01:12.960
for modern professional dubbing is to match lip movements as closely as possible. Now, there is a way

01:12.960 --> 01:18.000
to rephrase the sentence in Hindi so that the company name sits at the end. The dubbing team

01:18.000 --> 01:23.600
chose that option and the lip movements pretty much match. But the subtitling team didn't see any

01:23.600 --> 01:27.760
reason to do that, and so the lines are different. In Japanese, which has the same problem,

01:27.760 --> 01:32.400
the dubbing team instead found a translation where the lip movements look close enough.

01:33.120 --> 01:39.040
But why don't they just take the dubbing script and then turn it into subtitles? Why translate

01:39.040 --> 01:44.560
everything twice? Well, subtitles have their own limitations. I gave the translation teams for

01:44.560 --> 01:49.440
this video some deliberately difficult examples. A few years ago, I made a video on YouTube's

01:49.440 --> 01:54.320
copyright systems, and it's included this sidebar about a song that I don't like.

01:54.320 --> 01:58.240
Maroon 5's memories is an infuriating composition that uses the start of the melody of Canon

01:58.240 --> 02:01.440
in D, but never resolves it, which means that it has the same stuck-in-your-head effect as the

02:01.440 --> 02:06.480
jingle from Alphabetsto's The demolished man, and I hate it. The modern approach to subtitling,

02:06.480 --> 02:11.120
in most languages, is that reading is faster than talking, and that even for fast talking,

02:11.120 --> 02:16.160
like that, you put every word on screen. The viewer can always pause, but that wasn't always the case.

02:16.160 --> 02:19.920
If you watch anything in English that was subtitled more than 10 or 15 years ago, like

02:19.920 --> 02:25.360
reruns on television or movies on DVD, you'll find the subtitles often summarise what said.

02:25.360 --> 02:29.920
Style guides used to emphasise the skill in careful and sensitive subtitle editing,

02:29.920 --> 02:34.320
because they thought it was important that everyone got the meaning, even if they were a slow reader,

02:34.320 --> 02:39.200
because you couldn't easily pause and go back. And besides, why would someone who can hear,

02:39.200 --> 02:43.840
watch video with subtitles? It's not like we all end up with tiny televisions in our pocket,

02:43.840 --> 02:47.760
or sound mixing changes would mean that dialogue was going to be suddenly difficult to hear.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.080
In the original English version of that maroon 5 rant that I just did,

02:52.080 --> 02:56.480
I made a reference to the demolished man by Alfred Bester, which isn't that well known,

02:56.480 --> 03:00.000
even in English, so for Japanese viewers who have probably never heard of it,

03:00.000 --> 03:05.280
the local subtitle translator decided to remove the reference entirely and get the same meaning

03:05.280 --> 03:10.800
across in fewer characters. Opinions can differ, but I think that's a pretty solid decision.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.400
If they'd just taken the breathless high speed performance of the Japanese voice actor,

03:14.400 --> 03:19.280
then it would have been a worse experience for subtitle readers. And well done to the voice actor,

03:19.280 --> 03:25.600
by the way, that cannot have been easy. And this is just to translate one person performing a script.

03:25.600 --> 03:29.680
Imagine if it was a reality show with six people shouting and talking quickly and stumbling the

03:29.680 --> 03:34.960
words and interrupting each other, the subtitles would have to summarise, while the voice actors for

03:35.120 --> 03:41.360
the dub can shout over each other. But it does mean that in this case for some Japanese viewers,

03:42.000 --> 03:46.720
that reference is lost. That's one of the other big challenges with translation. How much do

03:46.720 --> 03:52.320
you translate the words versus translating the meaning? Here's another really difficult example.

03:53.520 --> 04:00.000
Anyone want to buy some gozzlings? They're going cheap. The English version of that joke is

04:00.000 --> 04:05.200
pretty much impossible to translate. It relies not just on a pun, but on knowledge of colloquial

04:05.200 --> 04:09.920
English. You have to know that going can mean making a noise. You have to know that cheap

04:09.920 --> 04:14.400
is the English word for the noise that baby birds make, cheap cheap cheap. And you have to know that

04:14.400 --> 04:22.240
going cheap spell differently is slang for unsail at a good price. I loved seeing the responses

04:22.240 --> 04:25.920
from the translations on this example. A couple of folks translated it word for word and just

04:26.000 --> 04:30.880
gave up on the joke. Fair enough. But I do want to highlight a couple of them. The Portuguese

04:30.880 --> 04:36.320
subtitle and dubbing teams came up with the same joke and so did the Spanish subtitle. Ganso,

04:36.320 --> 04:42.240
in both languages, means goose and cansado means tired. So they combined them into the word Gansado.

04:42.240 --> 04:47.520
And now I'm asking if anyone wants the gozzlings because I'm goose slash tired of them? Brilliant.

04:47.520 --> 04:51.920
And both the French and Spanish dubbing teams came up with their own puns based on their

04:51.920 --> 04:57.280
languages words for bird noises because yes, the sounds that animals are said to make

04:57.280 --> 05:03.120
differ in each language. And I love this. This is translating meaning and intent not just words.

05:03.120 --> 05:07.440
In case you're wondering, I did try several AI translation tools as well as just asking large

05:07.440 --> 05:12.720
language model to translate this stuff. And as of right now, as of 2023, capturing that nuance,

05:12.720 --> 05:17.760
that meaning, that performance definitely still requires humans. At least for the goose clip,

05:17.760 --> 05:21.360
the translators didn't have to match my lips, but they did have to match the goose's

05:21.360 --> 05:26.320
honk because I talked over it. So they had to go to another bit of the video that you didn't see,

05:26.320 --> 05:31.600
copy and paste the background noise and a different goose honk from there and synchronise them up.

05:31.600 --> 05:38.720
Someone had to lip sync a goose. Beaksync, actually. They don't have lips. I don't think they have lips.

05:38.720 --> 05:42.800
All of which comes together for this example. Last year, I made a video where I tried to get over

05:42.880 --> 05:48.640
my phobia of roller coasters and spoiler, I did. And just after my terror changed to joy on a ride

05:48.640 --> 06:00.960
called Nemesis, I shouted this. The original English is have it. How north do you translate have it?

06:00.960 --> 06:04.640
It's got no literal meaning and more than that, it's kind of obscure, slang, different people in

06:04.640 --> 06:09.280
different parts of Britain might use it for different things and it's almost impossible to google.

06:09.360 --> 06:14.320
In my context, it's a cry of excitement, triumph, adrenaline, encouragement, success. It's the

06:14.320 --> 06:18.720
sort of thing that you might yell after your team scores are goal or to cheer on your friend after

06:18.720 --> 06:25.040
they've successfully downed two points of the lager back to back. It feels very male, very drunken,

06:25.040 --> 06:30.080
lads night out. I did pass a note with all that context onto the translators, but for many

06:30.080 --> 06:34.640
productions, they won't be working with notes. They'll only have the original show and maybe

06:34.640 --> 06:39.360
the script if there is one. So here is that cry in all the videos languages.

07:04.880 --> 07:09.840
Subtitling teams have the choice of any word or phrase, but they have to fit the words on the screen.

07:09.840 --> 07:13.840
Dubbing teams can get the voice actors to emote in the studio as much as possible,

07:14.480 --> 07:20.880
but the lip movements have it to match. That's why subtitles and dubbing differ. And if you want a

07:20.880 --> 07:26.320
perfect example of that, this advert has also been translated into five languages and no matter which

07:26.320 --> 07:31.120
one you speak, you can push NordVPN's magic quick connect button and your phone and compute to

07:31.120 --> 07:36.160
can pretend that there are anyone of around 60 countries from Albania to Vietnam. So if you're

07:36.160 --> 07:40.560
traveling and want websites to stop automatically translating for you, it's easy. Or if you want to

07:40.560 --> 07:45.600
watch stuff from another country, but it's blocked where you are, you can. Just check the streaming

07:45.600 --> 07:51.280
services terms and conditions first. NordVPN works on Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS and Android,

07:51.280 --> 07:56.960
up to six devices at the same time, and there's a 30-day money back guarantee. So if you're not sure,

07:57.040 --> 08:02.320
try it anyway. When I first use it, I thought I'd only use it occasionally, but over the last year,

08:02.320 --> 08:08.080
it really has come in handy for me time after time after time. I keep endorsing NordVPN because

08:08.080 --> 08:13.200
it keeps being a thing I actually use. You can go to nordvpn.com slash Tom Scott or scan the QR code

08:13.200 --> 08:19.440
for the best dealer offering right now, even if you're watching this in the future. I think that

08:19.440 --> 08:21.440
what? Lovely.
