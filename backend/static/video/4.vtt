There's no such thing as central funeral force.

Who's here there?

As a physicist, I can assure you there is such a thing as central funeral force.

00:09.360 --> 00:13.200
You just have to be in a rotating frame of reference for experience.

You have to be in a non-linear or a non-neutral frame.

00:17.680 --> 00:21.200
But yeah, you can certainly get squished higher.

I don't know why high school physics teachers get so upset about it though.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.080
So anyway.
