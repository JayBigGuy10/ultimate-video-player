00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.070
lines all the center

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.360
[Music]

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.559
lines hey hey hey hi hi everybody Adam

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.359
Savage here in my cave

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.279
uh recently we've put up a few videos

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.960
about the fact that I reorganized the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.519
cave uh I significantly reorganized the

IP
00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.320
cave this room is fairly similar to what

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.079
it was except that it's more open

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.200
because I was able to move a lot of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.239
stuff out of this room and into this

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.719
room so this big room has become sort of

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.800
my hardware store and another workspace

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.640
sorry about the creaking and then this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.360
store is this room is more like my main

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.199
fabrication room where the machine tools

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.559
are it's like tools here hardware store

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.680
there work happens everywhere 15 years

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.520
ago or so my then cameraman on

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.039
MythBusters Tim Al would introduce me to

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.480
a system called

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.680
sortimo we've talked about it many times

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.040
on the channel here S O R T Mo this is

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.880
their t- boox with two x's one of my

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.759
favorite um Parts sorting designs in the

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.479
world with indexable and removable

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.520
compartments um and a clear

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.040
top I spent some real money back when I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.479
was making television money um

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.400
outfitting myself with a whole bunch of

IP
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.240
sortos and cross referencing them with

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.520
alphabetized cross reference list it's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.920
been a fantastic system here in the cave

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.600
and here they are in the hardware store

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.200
space uh and I have an issue with them

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.479
here despite their amazing utility which

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.159
is that every time I need something from

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.479
one of them I've got to pull it out and

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.439
find like a horizontal surface like this

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.399
table here to put it on so I can open it

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.520
up recently I acquired something

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.719
at a garage sale in San

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.520
Francisco I picked up this set of

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.239
drawers now they were full of a bunch of

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.280
stainless hardware and they're fantastic

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.200
but what I love most about them is what

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.200
you just saw happen pull it out open it

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.519
up get what you need

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.920
inside and I never had to take this

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.080
whole bin out to find a horizontal

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.680
surface for it

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.760
why this drawer system seems quite

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.200
useful and then I took a look at the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.720
sortos and I discovered that they

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.879
themselves have uh uh uh what looks like

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.959
artifacts for drawer slides here for

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.000
some sort of catch system so I attempted

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.040
to make some drawer slides that held

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.680
them with like um with little blocks of

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.599
acrylic out here and it was too

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.680
um it didn't

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.040
work there are mechanical reasons it

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.720
didn't work they're not important here

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.319
because that's not the solution I ended

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.799
up going with the solution I ended up

IP
00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.879
going with was to realize that I want

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.560
the same thing that those blue drawers

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.120
provide which is an actual metal shelf

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.040
that goes under one side across the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.000
bottom and up the other side and that

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.159
those could attach to the drawer

IP
00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.480
slides so all I needed was a single

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.000
sheet of aluminum and a pair of drawer

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.920
slides for each of the sordo cabinets

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.200
and

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.680
this this is what

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.640
we

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.959
this is the first test this is my my my

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.120
uh my try out of this now this is the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.760
very first drawer I built

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.760
um it has a little high here this is the

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.319
second one and I kind of worked out some

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.360
of the Kinks on that and as you can see

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.959
the drawer goes in the drawer goes in

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.720
here nice and right so now so now

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.400
theoretically if I had this system going

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.000
I can can pull out the drawer open it up

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.159
get what I need put it

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.159
back

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.720
and I no longer have to hunt for a

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.920
horizontal surface every time this is

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.799
what it led to is every time I needed

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.918
something as small as one of the parts

00:04:17.918 --> 00:04:21.918
in here I needed a table space this

00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:25.000
big every single time that's fine at the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.360
beginning of the day when there's only a

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.680
couple Tools in my workbench but within

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.560
an hour of barking on any project

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.680
there's like 40 50 tools lurking

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.520
about 40 or 50 okay maybe that's a

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.360
little too much but within like within a

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.840
short period of time all the horizontal

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.680
surfaces are covered with the project at

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.840
hand that is just a natural course of

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.199
things so I desire to make a drawer

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.919
system like this for all of my sortos in

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.280
there what does that actually

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.520
mean it means a lot of draw slides it

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.160
means a lot of pieces of aluminum it

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.400
means

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.400
a a study in um the specific kind of

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.000
manufacturing that is among the most

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.759
tedious and time

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.440
eating a particular facet of making

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.560
stuff is when you have to make many of

IP
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.280
one thing whenever you have to make many

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.520
many I'm not talking like 10 I'm talking

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.720
like 50 100 whenever you're in numbers

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.960
like that every operation can

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.199
add hours to your day if you have 70

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.560
things to make and you add a one minute

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.120
task that's well over an hour right

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.759
so suffice to say that when you are

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.240
embarking on making many efficiency is

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.440
super super important and I've been

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.960
cogitating this whole operation for for

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.000
weeks refining it refining it refining

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.919
it breaking down to simpler and simpler

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.930
pieces and chunks for instance I have to

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.160
[Music]

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.520
cut let's take a look at this piece of

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.000
aluminum here right so we've got a uh

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.360
we've got a piece of aluminum that's

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.400
bent up on the sides bent up on the back

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.680
the back is riveted to the sides and to

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.360
the drawer slides and there are punches

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.520
for the drawer slides for the rivets now

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.800
that means I've got a sheet of aluminum

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.360
I have to make four Cuts in 2 3 4 two

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.280
holes in uh sorry uh six holes in 1 2 3

IP
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.639
4 five six and four

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.720
bends 70 pieces of

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.120
aluminum four cuts each six holes each

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.919
four bends each I I can take one piece

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.599
of aluminum and do that in you know 15

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:00.400
minutes

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.120
yeah 15 minutes so let's extrapolate

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.840
that out uh 15 minutes that's 4 per hour

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.800
that means uh I would get 60 done

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.199
in 3

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.440
hours hold on all my math is wrong let

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:25.080
me at 15 minutes per times SE 15 minutes

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.759
a piece that's almost at 15 minutes per

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:31.080
sheet of aluminum that's over 18 hours

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.680
of work that's more than two full days

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.840
of my labor and I think I can go faster

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.280
um there's a company here in San

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.919
Francisco called Max metals and they

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.919
were able to deliver 70 sheets of

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:45.039
aluminum to me identically the same size

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:49.120
like this um I don't have

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.520
my I don't have the exact dimensions of

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.759
this off the top of my head but uh Max

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:55.759
medals did a beautiful job and it was

00:07:55.759 --> 00:08:00.080
very reasonably priced I used um for

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.720
this project I used

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.560
040 that's 40,000 or 1 mm thick 6061

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.039
aluminum that number delineates uh your

00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:14.440
standard aircraft alloy of aluminum um

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.039
now I had to

00:08:16.039 --> 00:08:19.800
make four Cuts in each sheet and two of

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.599
them are really easy cuts cuz they're

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:24.840
these Cuts it's just this big diagonal

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.720
that separates the side Bend from the

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.159
front Bend um I was bble to do that on

00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:35.679
my table saw um I built I built a

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.519
template this template with a uh a rack

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:40.279
in the back to guide it in the table

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:43.559
saws frame and I simply chucked the

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.440
piece of aluminum in here like

IP
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.800
this and made the cut here you can see

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.000
it

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.279
here that's how it went that that was

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:56.519
the cut when you have to make a ton of

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:58.800
cuts in sheets of metal or wood like

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.880
this this kind of template is amazing it

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.800
I was able to do this in stacks of 10

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.839
and five minutes so that was the first

00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:10.880
two cuts for all 70 sheets now I have to

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.680
make the second two cuts and it's more

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.079
complex because back here in this um

00:09:16.079 --> 00:09:18.839
back here in the corner here I want the

00:09:18.839 --> 00:09:22.519
back to Bend forward and connect to both

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:25.079
the side and the drawer slide that's a

00:09:25.079 --> 00:09:27.560
precise little hole Arrangement and it

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.240
means I have to cut a piece out of the

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.480
corner like this the striped part is

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.040
what gets cut

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.640
out this is a tough part to cut out um

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.720
specifically uh that cut I can do on a

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.839
band saw and that cut I can do on a band

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:44.640
saw but that

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.800
cut it's a little more tough so I think

IP
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.880
what I'm actually going to

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.480
do is I'm going to stack all 70 sheets

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.839
on the bed of my Mill milling machine

00:09:57.839 --> 00:09:59.600
and I'm going to come in here with

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.240
basically like a half in Milling

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.519
bit and I'm going to cut a hole here

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:10.560
like that that hole will allow me to

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.560
make these two cuts on the band saw

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.959
they'll just meet the hole boop

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:18.480
boop so drilling the hole in all 70

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.399
sheets that's two holes across them one

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:23.399
and two that should take less than 15

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:25.320
minutes and then the other Cuts just

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.839
another few minutes you know maybe like

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:30.079
30 minutes to do all the rest of the

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:33.560
cuts however before I do those

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.360
cuts I require to make the punches in

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.959
the sides uh to match the drawer slides

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:42.399
one of the nice things about full

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:44.920
extension drawer slides for installation

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.480
is that you can remove uh usually the

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.240
third extension and just attach this to

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.560
your piece

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.240
so this piece

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.800
dictates my um

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.360
my hole position right yeah it's that to

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.650
that

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:06.959
[Music]

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:12.360
and so that's the location of the two

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.240
holes this is a hole punch this is a

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.880
hole punch it punches a beautiful 1/8

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.600
inch hole so what I need to do is be

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.160
able to cut that

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.279
hole Yeah I got to

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
there and

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.120
then the other one is there okay

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.440
so if that is that

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.480
right so this means that I always get

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.399
the depth correct right because I'm

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:50.680
coming

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:54.040
in coming

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.440
in I guess I don't have to I can make

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.040
that cut now and then I can do all the

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.560
the whole whole drilling later okay I

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.170
thought that

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.360
[Music]

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.079
I it is easy for me to get too abstract

00:12:09.079 --> 00:12:11.079
about all the component parts I was

IP
00:12:11.079 --> 00:12:12.839
thinking I had to punch the holes before

00:12:12.839 --> 00:12:14.760
I made these Cuts but I don't think I

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.760
have to I think popping the holes is the

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.480
last thing

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.639
[Music]

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:25.720
before before we start to actually do

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.720
the bending so first I'm going to let's

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.040
get to this part let's get to these

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.460
[Music]

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.280

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.279
there you go that's the two holes

00:15:22.279 --> 00:15:26.839
drilled in all 70 sheets at once and I'm

00:15:26.839 --> 00:15:28.880
aware I know what you're think thinking

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.440
you're like hey why don't you just uh

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.600
Chuck that into your table saw and do

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.190
that slice all at once and

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.199
[Music]

00:15:38.199 --> 00:15:40.079
like

00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:43.360
no no no we're going to make this corner

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.399
cut uh a sheet at a time and we'll get

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:49.399
through all 70 in well less than 30

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:51.090
minutes I

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.249
[Music]

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.600

all right there they are the

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.640
they're all finished now it's just time

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.130
to work out the hole

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.229

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.890

00:17:54.679 --> 00:17:57.400
punching all

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.320
right

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.039
okay so if

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:05.039
do

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.039
that do

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.450
[Music]

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.320

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.280
[Music]

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.000
so I have completed the cutting and the

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.960
hole punching for 70 actually

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.200
60

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.080
yeah I have 65 perfect pieces that's how

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.320
many drawers I need so we're going to go

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.880
over to the metal break now and set that

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.200
puppy up but first i'm going to have a

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.400
meeting and I'm going to come back after

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.440
the meeting it won't make any any

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.000
difference to you you won't notice but

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.840
I'll see you in a minute okay

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.679
um my sheets are fully punched did I

00:19:06.679 --> 00:19:08.799
just go over this sheets are ready for

00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:12.000
bending um and just like all the other

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.960
I've set this up so I have the same

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.760
amount of distance from the back as I do

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.240
from the sides so I don't need to change

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.679
those orientations but I'm not going to

00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:23.559
do them all in one I'm going to do all

00:19:23.559 --> 00:19:25.559
the back bends

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:28.360
first and then I'm going to do the sides

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.000
and you'll see it's a there's a there's

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.910
a process uh but we're going

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.000
[Music]

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.039
to just get a little bit of more

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:41.720
tightening going

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.670
[Music]

00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:57.600
on so I have to I have to get this right

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.480
right now

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.080
that's not quite

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.020
night too far

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.190
[Music]

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.609
[Music]

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.460
[Music]

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:29.159
off

00:20:29.159 --> 00:20:31.159
what I end up with there is some really

00:20:31.159 --> 00:20:35.039
ni a nice Bend there that's really great

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:36.360
that's

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.679
ideal and that one too that's nice those

00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:41.480
that's um that's an extra bit of

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.000
structure I'm getting out of this uh and

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.200
then the last Bend will be

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.039
the so do I do all the back bends first

00:20:50.039 --> 00:20:53.000
is the question

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.799
crazy

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:57.120
no I'm going to have

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.120
to

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:13.440
oh that's great I don't mind that at

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.000
[Music]

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.840
all

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.960
so it starts like

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:27.039
this you start with you

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:30.039
do

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.289
[Music]

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.880
[Music]

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.380
yeah I like

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.720
[Music]

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.960
that all right let's do a

00:21:57.039 --> 00:22:00.039
stopwatch

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.120
all right I'm I'm

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.440
uh I have completed 40 drawers worth of

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.159
bending I have 25 to go they're all

00:22:29.159 --> 00:22:30.400
right

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.520
here um the big issues with the drawer

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.760
slides is

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.360
parallelism so I don't want any of these

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.919
lines to get bowed out those lines have

00:22:44.919 --> 00:22:47.279
to be nice and straight and they got to

00:22:47.279 --> 00:22:48.799
be super

00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:51.679
parallel um because it's aluminum it is

00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:53.919
somewhat

00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:56.520
adjustable I have some adjustability but

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.799
my job is made a lot easier if I start

00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:03.240
out parallel and Straight Orlando comes

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.760
in tomorrow and we're going to start him

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.120
off doing some rivet holes in these guys

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.919
and then uh attaching the third stage

00:23:12.919 --> 00:23:15.279
drawer slides to all of

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:18.640
them um and then to start marking out

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.279
our big pieces of 3/4 inch we got some

00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:24.279
3/4 inch Birch ply not great it's Birch

00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:26.559
finish but inside it's like a horror

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:28.440
show it's like garbage dump in there

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.919
uh however it's perfectly structural for

00:23:30.919 --> 00:23:32.640
us what we're going to end up doing is

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.279
we're going to end up building a uh a

00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:38.480
rack of three stacks of 13 and a second

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.640
rack of two stacks of

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.159
13 why why those breakdowns I thought of

00:23:43.159 --> 00:23:45.720
doing two two in one and then I realized

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.760
that three and two use the least amount

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.640
of uprights of wood I get some real

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.320
efficiencies that way uh to make a three

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.000
stack I only need four pieces of wood

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.679
and to make a two stack I only need

00:23:56.679 --> 00:24:01.279
three um so that's seven total plus

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:04.799
enough um this work is tiring in a

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:07.200
particular way

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.960
um and I I often like keep it

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.000
interesting by this job is actually

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.640
almost this is big enough

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:20.080
that how do I say this I often I often

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.120
assuage the tum I often ass swash the

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.159
tedium of a job like this by doing math

00:24:25.159 --> 00:24:26.799
in my head watching the clock and seeing

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.760
how many I'm getting done seeing how

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.320
fast it's going um I will say also when

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.520
you're working with sheet metal your

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.640
hands get just carved to ribbons with

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.420
paper cuts

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.000
[Music]

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.279
um however all of this is looking really

00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:43.279
really

00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:46.000
great

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.760
uh

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.360
yeah I don't know could we be assembling

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.240
these by the end of the day

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.760
tomorrow oh right we're not doing a live

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.159
stre tomorrow we're doing that the next

00:24:59.159 --> 00:25:02.279
day all right uh but right now I'm going

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:04.559
to go home and feed Maggie and prep for

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:06.240
dinner we're having some friends over so

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.399
I will see you guys in 20 seconds but

00:25:09.399 --> 00:25:13.540
for me 15 hours or so

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:46.970
[Music]

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.279
okay with um 65 some OD there may be an

00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:52.720
extra one or two here uh drawer slides

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.039
all installed the third stage of each of

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:57.360
the full extension slides is installed

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.799
on my drawer they're nice and rigid I'm

00:25:59.799 --> 00:26:02.360
really happy with how flat everything is

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.440
I'm going to I'm going to set up some

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.520
wood here on the table as a kind of

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.240
quality control and I'm going to just

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.480
take a look at the parallelism of all of

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.559
these I'm just going to give a a check

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:18.399
and if some of them are slightly out of

00:26:18.399 --> 00:26:20.760
size I may gather those

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.080
together everything depends on these all

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.799
being the same as each other and given

00:26:25.799 --> 00:26:29.600
that I punch the holes At Con den

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.760
den distances and that I bent them at

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.120
constant

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.600
[Music]

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.559
distances that was a rough one uh they

00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:42.799
should be really

00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:46.480
close oh we're going to find

00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:52.840
out by the way the one that I ended up

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.039
with extra specifically does not have a

00:26:57.039 --> 00:27:00.240
removal pin here and you actually can

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.600
see it you can actually kind of see it

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.080
in there but for some reason it's not

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.640
coming out and rather than

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.080
troubleshooted I bought enough then I

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.559
just TOS this one by the

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:26.520
[Music]

[Music]

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.559
here you can see this see that those

00:28:07.559 --> 00:28:09.440
look

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.159
great

00:28:11.159 --> 00:28:15.880
right those these look pretty

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:20.099
[Music]

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.600
good this is bad this is bad and it's

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.679
boring uh my Headstrong progress is

00:28:28.679 --> 00:28:33.039
halted cuz I have to undo all of

00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:35.960
these they're totally

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.880
bad so uh yeah that's what I'm doing I

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.600
got to undo them

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:56.080
[Music]

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.000
all maybe I I should give you an shot my

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.279
issue here is that there's no

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:03.679
consistency it's off here off by an

00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:06.760
eight there off by an eight and I think

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.000
I know what I need to do but first I

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.279
just need to undo all of these which is

00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:12.910
really

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:26.320
[Music]

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.320
boring

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:02.970
[Music]

00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:16.480
I I should point out this is making in a

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.320
nutshell thinking you have gleaned or

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.440
gained

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:26.000
some insight into a process only to find

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.279
it vexes you at the last possible

00:30:31.399 --> 00:30:34.600
second I've been here before oh there we

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.519
go I just want to saay for the record

00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:38.640
I'm like 15 minutes into cleaning up and

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.320
I don't want to clean up right now I

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.279
like want to go home and sit in a

00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:45.360
funk but there's really no reason to

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.200
have a funk this is really remarkable

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.279
this is amazing I this is the best shelf

00:30:50.279 --> 00:30:52.480
thing that's ever happened in my shop

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.519
these are the ones I took out I'm going

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:55.639
to throw them look I just wanted to stop

00:30:55.639 --> 00:30:57.039
and tell you that I don't want to clean

00:30:57.039 --> 00:31:00.559
up right now and yet I'm cleaning

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:03.559
up that's how that works

00:31:03.559 --> 00:31:08.159
sometimes it's a new day it's a new dawn

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:12.919
it's a new life for me yeah it's a new

00:31:12.919 --> 00:31:16.120
day it's a new

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.720
dawn and I'm

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.300
feeling

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.200
[Music]

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.639
good the clows look at that five five

00:31:27.639 --> 00:31:30.320
five five stacks of

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.760
[Music]

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.360
13 that one still

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.639
sticks I was so vexed last night

00:31:38.639 --> 00:31:42.880
um anyway I'll fix that that's

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.080
fixable the next thing

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.320
so we're very close to moving in uh

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.840
notice that I have put casters under

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.600
every upright that's

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.720
because the amount of weight these

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.600
things hold is a

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.639
hidden is um it's more than you think my

00:32:04.639 --> 00:32:07.440
bearings my bearings been alone is like

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.960
12 lb so anyway I didn't want any droop

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.519
this wasn't the best Plywood And that's

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:15.720
actually a key issue for me the plywood

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.519
here looks

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:20.559
really yeah it's

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:23.960
like y hold on I'll show

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.880
you here's my um

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.760
here is a

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.000
lesson

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.279
and there we

00:32:34.279 --> 00:32:36.639
go this is why I don't like app ply with

00:32:36.639 --> 00:32:39.639
this is the Live Edge wait wait wait

00:32:39.639 --> 00:32:42.840
first let's take a look at my why am my

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.399
head there we go first let's take a look

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:46.880
at my bread and butter plywood which is

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.000
Baltic Birch ply and you get those like

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.399
look at how pretty that is and that is

00:32:52.399 --> 00:32:55.120
uniform that edge of the Baltic Birch

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.639
play can be used as a design element and

00:32:58.639 --> 00:33:02.720
to be fair to be really fair to a ACX

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.559
3/4 in uh Lumberyard ply

00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:09.519
like it's always kind of like this it's

00:33:09.519 --> 00:33:12.639
not bad our local Lumbard has a sale on

00:33:12.639 --> 00:33:17.720
this ply with a nice service finish but

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.600
inside

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.639
it's look at this I I mean listen I

00:33:23.639 --> 00:33:24.799
don't begrudge people their

00:33:24.799 --> 00:33:26.639
manufacturing methods that's fine I'm

00:33:26.639 --> 00:33:29.639
glad to pay less for this plywood but

00:33:29.639 --> 00:33:31.320
like when you look at it up close it's

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.000
freaking head cheese anyway it's hideous

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:35.960
to look

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.240
upon I didn't know I would have a point

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.519
of view about that that's the funny

00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:41.799
thing about a point of view you don't

00:33:41.799 --> 00:33:44.240
often knows what yours is until it

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.480
arrives anyway uh the next thing I want

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.480
to do I'm going to slice I've got some

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.120
I've got some nice regular wood in a in

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.399
a in

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:56.559
a I'm basically going to cut some wood

00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:58.840
dressing strips and I'm going to dress

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:03.760
the fronts of these 1 2 3 4 5 six seven

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.200
uprights it's a lot of things but yeah

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.559
I'm going to do that to make it look

00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:09.359
nice isn't that nice isn't that much

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:11.639
nicer look at

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:15.480
that there's that and there's that you

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.239
may wonder why I left this little

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:21.440
um this little boop boop right here

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.359
that's actually where the alphabetical

00:34:23.359 --> 00:34:26.079
list goes of everything that's in there

00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:29.320
mhm I might even go up to

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.879
like 12p Point type something I don't

00:34:31.879 --> 00:34:34.720
know I had a pretty

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:41.040
small sh it's time it's time we're going

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.210
to

[Music]

00:34:43.918 --> 00:34:49.440
um sordos come out shelves go in sordos

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.839
go in here's how this

00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:55.520
go happen let's

00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:58.879
see

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.880
so first

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:12.639
[Music]

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.180
up come

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:25.800
[Music]

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.800
on

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.319
hey there um so I have just

00:35:49.319 --> 00:35:51.119
completed the

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:55.319
installation of my 65 sordo trays each

00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:58.160
one comes out and allows

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.040
access

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.040
um now it's time to populate it I've

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.960
changed some of the ordering

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.359
numbers so I'm basically about to do a

00:36:09.359 --> 00:36:12.000
complete repopulation of this and then

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
tonight I'm going to build a new a new

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.920
uh spreadsheet of all of the articles

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.280
that are in here

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.960
uhhuh

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.440
so yeah I'm just going to ask uh my uh

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.520
computer to play some

00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:36.040
music and uh then we're going to uh

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.680
we're going to do

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.590
[Music]

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.680
this

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:03.980
[Music]

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.839
yeah it's

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.520
happening this is so much

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:23.319
work so much work here um

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.440
but the reor has happened now it's time

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.880
to document I know I've been taping it

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.560
I've

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.520
been recording

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.800
it and look at all these old

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.200
sordos yes don't worry if you're

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.680
wondering if some of those will become

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.599
available they

00:37:44.599 --> 00:37:47.920
will but right now it's time for me to

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:52.680
go through I have 65 slots I have used

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.000
63 of them which is an addition of an

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.560
addition of uh five more than I had

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.599
before I didn't expect to fill five I

00:38:04.599 --> 00:38:07.200
still have some baby fat left over in

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.560
some of the some of these and I have two

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.040
extras way down here that are completely

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.240
empty completely Blue Sky could be

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.040
anything they

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.520
want so now it's time to build the

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.160
spreadsheet

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.200
um maybe I should have opened with this

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:28.119
everything is labeled on its face with

00:38:28.119 --> 00:38:30.599
the main things that it

00:38:30.599 --> 00:38:33.079
has but there are all sorts of

00:38:33.079 --> 00:38:34.800
subcategories that aren't represented by

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.440
the labels here this is the broad like

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.240
hey where is that thing and things are

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.960
roughly categorically where they should

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.480
be for in instance everything that's

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.760
rivet is here Springs and npt fittings

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.640
O-rings rubber corks all that stuff uh

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.280
lives here nuts and bolts are almost

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.960
this entire column uh uh this is also a

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.839
lot of nuts and bolts but also some

00:38:59.839 --> 00:39:02.560
spacers and things over here this entire

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.200
column is almost all

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.040
Electronics um this one is ancillary

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.440
stuff handles jewelry things like that

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.240
but what I want is a picture of every

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.280
single case yeah then I'm going to load

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.520
all 63 of those pictures in and build a

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.839
brand new Excel spreadsheet from

00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:24.119
scratch yeah that's what we're going to

00:39:24.119 --> 00:39:26.680
do when you have a maker shop when you

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.720
have a general maker

00:39:29.839 --> 00:39:33.319
shop categorization is so

00:39:33.319 --> 00:39:37.680
difficult and I have I have too many

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.359
electronics things to fit solely into

00:39:40.359 --> 00:39:42.760
like one even one column of this because

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.599
there are bigger things in electronics

00:39:44.599 --> 00:39:46.640
so I've got the a whole airplane food

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.119
cart devoted to electronics with the

00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:51.040
soldering station on top and all of that

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.960
and in there was stuff that was doubled

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.400
up over here that I didn't even know

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.160
about

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:02.319
I also discovered my nut rivet insert

00:40:02.319 --> 00:40:06.520
anyway I it's not worth going over

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:12.400
but this is a great exercise to do

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.040
um to be

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.440
clear what I'm going to end up with is a

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.319
list like this one

00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:25.599
W which is a list of everything pop

00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:28.400
rivets they're in number three not here

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.920
this is the last or or organization L

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.880
brackets oh nice

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:40.800
um and so the the the the the mo is I'm

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.480
going to go through I've taken a picture

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.520
of every single container here they are

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.880
you can take a look at them I stand here

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.560
I take a picture like

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.119
this and as long as I take only one

00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:56.839
picture per container I have 60 two full

00:40:56.839 --> 00:40:59.400
containers here the moment I load them

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.079
into my

00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:03.800
computer and air dropped them over which

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:08.200
happened beautifully uh they there's 62

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.960
of them so uh in Bridge I did a battery

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:17.599
name starting at number 01 and low the

00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:23.920
names of each individual picture in here

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:29.000
is sordo right now I'm on sordo 45 and I

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.599
can see a uh there we go that's what I

00:41:32.599 --> 00:41:36.040
see in sordo 45 I come on over here and

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.119
I pull out this connector you will see

00:41:40.119 --> 00:41:44.920
ho ho it is the selfsame one I've picked

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.280
literally the hardest one to close in

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.800
this entire rack uh because it's got all

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.800
this extra wire sticking up it needs a

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.440
little bit of swaging it's uh it's hard

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.000
with these things that have long tails

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.359
still I prefer this mode of uh

00:42:01.359 --> 00:42:05.839
storage to nearly any other uh there we

00:42:05.839 --> 00:42:07.599
go good

00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:10.839
um and so then I sit there and I I open

00:42:10.839 --> 00:42:13.680
up an Excel spreadsheet which I've got

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:19.079
right here and I do 45 I have connectors

00:42:19.079 --> 00:42:22.520
and I know that actually I'm going to do

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.920
connect

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.079
doors X X

00:42:27.079 --> 00:42:33.480
LR uh I'm going to go back and do 45 XL

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.359
x

00:42:35.359 --> 00:42:38.240
x

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.240
XLR

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.400
connectors um I've got Barrel connectors

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.599
I've

00:42:46.599 --> 00:42:49.599
got

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:57.800
45 barrel connectors 45 connectors

00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.720
barrel

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.200
45 uh

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.400
alligator

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.140
clips

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.480
[Music]

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.480
45

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.160
um what do you call those oh uh those

00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:28.079
are

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.559
connectors

00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:31.480
assorted

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.000
um those called those are

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.680
called RCA

00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:45.680
connectors so 45 back I don't pull each

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.760
one out I only pulled this one out to

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.800
show you

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.359
um so that

00:43:53.359 --> 00:43:56.920
46 if I load it up here's 46

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.839
now I have all the things I need for 46

00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:02.280
and I just start going back and forth

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.359
and doing uh

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.960
46 this is incandescent

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:19.280
lights and this is

00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:24.319
46 wait that's 50

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.240
wait oh it's upside down that's why I

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.960
was oh yes yes yes whoop whoop whoop 59

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.800
oh we're into the costume

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.720
jewelry I took I am no good at

00:44:40.359 --> 00:44:42.520
Excel but I'm good enough to make it

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:46.319
work here so then what I want to do is I

00:44:46.319 --> 00:44:50.480
want to uh let's see I think I

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:57.960
want to move this one there and this one

00:44:59.079 --> 00:45:02.359
all right I figured it out uh I first I

00:45:02.359 --> 00:45:03.520
start with the numbers in the left

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.280
column and then I fill in all the stuff

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.319
on the right then I move the numbers

00:45:07.319 --> 00:45:10.240
column over to the other side select

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.359
both and do sort but only by column A

00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:16.079
alphabetically that's how this works oh

00:45:16.079 --> 00:45:19.119
my goodness I have to

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.880
go
